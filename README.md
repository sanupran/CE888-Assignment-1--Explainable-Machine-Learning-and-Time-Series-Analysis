# CE888-Assignment-1--Explainable-Machine-Learning-and-Time-Series-Analysis


This repository is about the Agrotech project, Explainable Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can help growers plan ahead for their crops by giving them information about the expected size of the crops in a future date. Using this system, they should be able to talk to supermarkets about when and how much produce they can sell them, resulting in a measurable gain for the growersâ€™ business. To do this, they have given you historical data from previous crops, as well as weather data.
