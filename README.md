# CE888- AgroTech: A data driven approach towards Digitised ( Final Project)
Agriculture


This repository is about the Agrotech project, Explainable Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can help growers plan ahead for their crops by giving them information about the expected size of the crops in a future date. Using this system, they should be able to talk to supermarkets about when and how much produce they can sell them, resulting in a measurable gain for the growersâ€™ business. To do this, they have given you historical data from previous crops, as well as weather data.


The dataset is a private dataset and hence cannot be uploaded on the platform.

To run the code, kindly provide the path of the dataset into the jupyter notebook when prompted after running the first cell. 

Continue running all the cells after to perform stepwise preprocessing and the application of regression algorithm.
